What is HashTable ?
Hash tables are data structures
we commonly use map/dict all these are using hash table data structure

A Hash Table transforms a key into an integer index using a hash function,
and the index will decide where to store the key/value pair in memory:
[
    0: [key, value],
    1: [key, value]
]


index collision ? 
is a problem when to two keys generate similar index so we handle this using nested arrays for one hashed index
[
    0: [
        [key, value],
        [key, value]
    ],
    1: [
        [k, v],
        [k, v]
    ]
]
